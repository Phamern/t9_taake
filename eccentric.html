              The avant garde images that French photographer Pol Kurucz creates
              are bright, surrealist, and provocative reflections on society. We
              asked Pol a few questions to dig into his creative mindset:

          <p data-aos="fade-in" class="paragraph1">
            Pol was born with two different names to a French mother in a
            Hungarian hospital. His childhood hyperactivity was treated with
            theater, and theater was later treated with finance. By 27 he was a
            manager by day and a stage director by night. He then went on
            consecutive journeys to Bahrain and Brazil, to corporate islands and
            favelas.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph2">
            He has sailed on the shores of the adult industry and of militant
            feminism and launched a mainstream money making bar loss making in
            its indie art basement. Then he suddenly died of absurdity. He was
            reborn in 2015 and merged his two names and his contradictory lives
            into one where absurdity makes sense. Today he works on eccentric
            fashion, celebrity and fine art projects in São Paulo and New York.

          <h1 class="q1">How do you define yourself as a photographer?</h1>
          <p class="answer1">
            I try not to define myself, but rather the visual universe into
            which I integrate the different types of projects I am working on:
            fine art, fashion and celebrity. The main pillars of this universe
            are the non-conventional, yet pleasing, combination of saturated,
            non-primary colors, stylized sets, props and compositions,
            provocative messages, glam-cool styling, and models with unusual
            beauty.

            Can you walk us through your workflow on set? What about
            post-production?
          </h1>
          <p class="answer2">
            The workflow is always the same. We build our sets the day before
            the photoshoot. The same day, we do lighting and tests of our props.
            We leave the studio at night in a way that the next day, we are
            ready to shoot. Models, makeup and hair come early since we usually
            work with wigs or complex hair structures. We start shooting around
            10am and finish around 8pm – with 4-6 images that I will find good
            enough to be published, sold, or in case of commercial projects,
            used by the client. I am extremely detail-oriented and spend much
            more time on the set with the model, rather than behind the camera,
            which is almost always on a tripod.

            Post-production is fairly simple. In terms of color, saturation,
            contrast, and general luminosity, what comes out of Capture One is
            90% of the end photo. On the day or a few days after the photoshoot,
            I export the RAW file into tif, make simple local adjustments, and
            send both the RAW and the tif to a retoucher. We then take forever
            to finalize the retouched image.

            These series are very vivid – what is your color management process?
